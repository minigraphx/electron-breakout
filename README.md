This is a Mini Breakout Game  
for testing Phaser with Typescript and Electron

TODO: 
- give ball a more random rotation to start
    probably doesn't matter if up or down
- change to sprites instead of geometric objects
- ball could probably start at paddle on space
    - or we make it an addon (maybe better)
- Level Editor (public / private levels - release dev states) 
- Highscore day / week / monthly / all-time
- Multiplayer
- SoundFX
- Music
- (hit help could use the angle the ball moves to show if it will hit)
- AI (for demo run - and easier testing)
